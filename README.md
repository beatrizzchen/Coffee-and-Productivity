Conducted a statistical and research project on the effects of caffeine and productivity as a final project for _COGS108, "Data Science in Practice" at the University of California, San Diego,_ 2025. 

Following the research question, _"How does caffeine consumption, measured in milligrams (mg), impact the productivity and work hours of individuals aged 18-29, as measured by self-reported performance? Given the rising trend of caffeine use among young adults for enhanced productivity alongside concerns about declining health, what is the correlation between caffeine intake and their work efficiency?",_ our team conducted several statistical analyses to test both qualitative and quantitative data to identify correlations.
